## Presentations

The goals of the Tableau projects vary, but are always to present information clearly. Product and Customer Analysis and RowrCare dashboards are newer works; while EV - Tesla Overview and RedJet are older.

* Product and Customer Analysis

* RowrCare is analyzing sample data about an imaginary pet care service.

* RedJet operated under the assumption that an employee was tasked with finding where to expand the current business.  Therefore, it was an internal company business pitch with an employee pitching to his team the possibility of them expanding the company into the subscription private jet industry. The project included finding the data, and creating all the financial analysis, models, comparisons, and the presentation in under 48 hours.

* EV was a curiosity comparison of Tesla, Ford, and General Motors with only public data that anyone could find on the internet.
