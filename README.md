## Presentations

The goals of the Tableau projects vary, but are always to present information. 

* RedJet operated under the assumption that an employee was tasked with finding where to expand the current business.  Therefore, it was an internal company business pitch with an employee pitching to his team the possibility of them expanding the company into the subscription private jet industry. The project included creating all the financials, models, comparisons, and the presentation in under 48 hours.

* EV was a curiosity comparison of Tesla, Ford, and General Motors with only public data that anyone could find on the internet.

* RowrCare is analyzing sample data about an imaginary pet care service.
